1. Introduction:
Provide an overview of the study’s objectives, rationale, and the surgical interventions being
compared (TPLO vs. lateral suture stabilization).

2. Study Design:
Describe the study design, including randomization methods, blinding procedures, and the
sample size (50 dogs per group). 

3. Data Collection:
Explain how peak vertical force and LOAD scores were collected, including equipment and
quality control procedures.

4. Baseline Characteristics:
Provide summary statistics for baseline characteristics (e.g., age, breed, preoperative severity)
separately for each treatment group.

5. Primary Outcome:
Dene the primary outcome as peak vertical force.
Justify its selection as the primary outcome measure.
6. Secondary Outcomes:
Dene the secondary outcome as LOAD scores.
Explain the relevance of LOAD scores in assessing treatment effects.

7. Statistical Analysis Objectives:
State the primary and secondary statistical objectives, including hypotheses of interest.

8. Statistical Methods: a. Primary Outcome Analysis:
Perform an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare peak vertical force between treatment
groups.
Include baseline peak vertical force as a covariate to adjust for baseline differences.Page 13/17
Check the assumptions of ANCOVA, including normality of residuals and homogeneity of
variances. b. Secondary Outcome Analysis:
Analyze LOAD scores using an appropriate method (e.g., linear regression or mixed-effects
model).
Include baseline LOAD scores as covariates to adjust for baseline differences.
Assess the normality of residuals for the secondary outcome. c. Assessment of Normality:
Conduct normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) on both primary and
secondary outcome variables.
Consider transformations (e.g., log transformation) or non-parametric alternatives if data are
signicantly non-normal. d. Handling Missing Data:
Use multiple imputation or appropriate imputation methods to handle missing data, maintaining
transparency in reporting the imputation process.
Report the proportion of missing data for each variable.

9. Model Assumptions:
Assumptions for ANCOVA include normality of residuals and homogeneity of variances. Verify
these assumptions using diagnostic plots.
For regression or mixed-effects models, assumptions include linearity, independence of
residuals, and homoscedasticity. These should be checked using residual plots.

10. Sample Size Calculation:
Conrm that the sample size of 50 dogs per group was determined based on appropriate
assumptions and power calculations for the primary outcome.

11. Data Presentation:
Describe how the results will be presented, including tables, gures, and the presentation of
effect sizes and condence intervals.

12. Ethical Considerations:
Mention any ethical considerations related to data analysis, including the welfare of the study
participants (dogs).

13. Timeline:
Provide an estimated timeline for data analysis and reporting.

14. Reporting:
Specify the intended audience for the study results (e.g., scientic journals, conferences).
Discuss plans for publication and dissemination of results.

15. Appendices:
Attach any additional documents, such as the statistical code used for analysis, data
dictionaries, or data collection forms.
It’s essential to adhere to this analysis plan rigorously to maintain the study’s validity. Collaboration with
a statistician or data analyst experienced in clinical trials is highly recommended to ensure that the
analysis plan aligns with best statistical practices and accounts for the specic characteristics of your
data
